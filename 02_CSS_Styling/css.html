        <h3>What is HTML</h3>
        <p>
            HTML is the abbreviation for Hyper Text Markup Language, 
            and is the code, or language that is used for the creation of basic website layouts. 
            It can look a little daunting if you've never done any coding before, 
            but all you need to try it out is an ordinary text editing application and an internet browser. 
            You might even recognize some HTML used to change text in online forums, customized online profiles,
            or even some wikiHow articles. HTML is a useful tool for anyone who uses the internet, 
            and learning the basics may take you less time than you think.

            "Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, 
            either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. 
            By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, 
            you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.

        <h2>Uses of HTML Language</h2>
        <h3>1. Web pages development</h3>
        <p>
            HTML is heavily used for creating pages displayed on the world wide web. 
            Every page contains a set of HTML tags, including hyperlinks used for connecting to other pages. 
            Every page that we witness on the world wide web is written using a version of HTML code.

        <h3>2. Web document Creation</h3>
        <p>
             HTML and its basic concept via tags and DOM (Document Object Model) dominate online document creation.
             Developers insert HTML tags before and after phrases to determine their formatting and placement on the page. 
             A web document has three sections: title, head, and body. The head includes the information to identify the document, 
             including the title and any other important keywords. A title can be seen on the browser’s bar, and the body section is the main portion of the website visible to the viewer. 
             The use of HTML tags designs and creates all three segments. Every section renders specific tags, 
            dedicatedly maintaining the loop between the head, title, and body concepts.</p>

        <h3>Why we use HTML?</h3>
        <p>
            HTML is used to create the structure of web pages and website that are displayed on the Internet. HTML basically contains Tags and Attributes 
            that are used to design the web pages. Also, we can link multiple pages using Hyperlinks.
